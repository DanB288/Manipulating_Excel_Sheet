# All files below are samples only

##### The name and position of columns will be same, don't worry about it but it would be great if you can identify the heading from row 1 and use from that perspective

##### There might be case where the Hacktobefest_Expected_Output.xlsx might have colors which don't precisely map to Hacktoberfest_database.xlsx (I tried a sample, please bare with this for now. I'll update precisely the correct colors. Incase you understand the requirements, feel free to grab the issues)
